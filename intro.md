# How to use

- Open Postman
- Click on import
- Import the JSON file

This will import all of the requests, variables and authorisation data that you require.

Now right click on the collection and click "edit".

You will see the authorisation and variables tabs.  You'll need to update them.

## Notes
- The API key won't work as I have disabled it and set up a new one.  

- You will need to set up your own using companies house https://developer.companieshouse.gov.uk/

- Remember that you need to put the API key in the username and there is NO password.

- You also need to add a colon : after the api key.

- You need to change all of the variables.  I used my company number, so you can use that if you want.  In some searches it won't work as my company does not have a mortgage and I have not been disqualified as an officer.  For those searches you will need to find someone who has.
